Check for removed URLs
======================

As of version 1.2.0, the starter pack includes a GitHub action to
identify when page URLs have been removed. This includes moving pages to another
path, or removing them completely.

This does not cover larger changes to URL paths, such as changing the RTD project
name, or language and versioning structure provided by RTD.

This check is available to ensure that redirects are implemented when pages are
moved, or appropriate information can be provided when anything is removed.
